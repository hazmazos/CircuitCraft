A program that uses 2 Potentiometers, 3 Leds, 3 1K Resistors and appropiate wire connections to allow for the selection of 3 leds
whilst also offering the ability to adjust the brightness of each led.

not working yet - leds arent getting to full brightness and dimmer does not appear to have any visible affect so needs testing and improving :(
